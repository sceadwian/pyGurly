Game design

Select character
Characters <- saved in a CSV file . File name should be "character_name.txt" based on name of character

Shows character profile -> select  level you would like to play
Levels shown based on reading the folder for any files that start with the work map_01-Level 1

Levels  <- available to be loaded as CSV files with first ??? lines being the map and the last ??? lines define different aspects of map such as loot and mobs?
        opt. potentially make this into a text based game perhaps???

#worked on fn_fight function
##can we change the fn_fight function to be much more elaborate. Start by showing the user the name and the stats of both fighters selected. Then a loop begins where in each round each character is assigned a variable life_var=(hp*10), the neach character delivers an attack (atk_var is what this variable should be called) based the sum of their cut, bleed, blunt, poison, curse, fire, multiplied by their atk. This summed attack value is subtracted by their opponents p_def and m_def. The remaining damange is subtracted from their life variable (life_var).  When the variable life_var reaches 0 or less the character loses and the other one is consider the winner. The function then returns the name of the winner 'name'
##can you change the function you just gave me so that the amount of attack in each round is determined by only one of the 6 types of damage (cut,bleed,blunt,poison,curse,fire) which will be chosen randomly each round. The damage chosen will be multiplied by the atk to calculate the attack power for that character that round. Additionally, if the damage is either cut, bleed or blunt, subtract the opponents p_def from the attack power. If the damage is either curse, fire or poison, then subtract the opponents m_def from the attack power. make sure fighter1_life and figher2_life continue to be their hp*10
#
#e
#added a little drama with time between rounds of the fight. e4 - colour and improvement of code.
#
#f added the main loop which can be used to stop the program
#write python3 code asking "If you would like to stop simulating fights enter the number 0". If user enters the value zero, change variable cont_loop to zero.
#f3 - boosted the importance of defense by adding a 50% change of doubling it and 10% chance of tripling it.
#g - added functionality of randomly picking the contestants of the fight.
